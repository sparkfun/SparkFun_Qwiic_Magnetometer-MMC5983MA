The SparkFun Qwiic Micro MMC5983MA Magnetometer takes the highly sensitive triple-axis magnetometer by MEMSIC. We've attached the magetometer IC onto an incredibly small Qwiic board form factor that we like to call, Qwiic Micro! The MMC5983MA is capable of sensing down to 0.4mG enabling a heading accuracy of ±0.5°. Output rates of 1000Hz, ±8G FSR, and 18-bit resolution make the MMC5983MA a phenomenal magnetic sensor for electronic compass applications.

Saturation is a problem for all mag sensors. The MMC5983MA has built-in degaussing circuitry to clear any residual magnetization.

We've got a feature complete Arduino library supporting I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI. Just search "SparkFun MMA5983MA" in the library manager and get measuring within minutes.
